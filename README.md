# Resume Optimization Platform

ATS-aware. Human-friendly. Ethical by design.

An open-source resume optimization engine that helps candidates pass Applicant Tracking
Systems (ATS) without sacrificing human readability.

## 🚀 Vision

Build a resume optimization system that balances ATS compatibility with human clarity,
ensuring resumes pass automated screening and resonate with real recruiters. We believe
resumes should be optimized — not robotic.

## ❗ Problems We Solve

- Over-optimization for ATS that hurts human readability
- Keyword stuffing without meaningful context
- AI-generated resume text that sounds unnatural
- Black-box suggestions with no explanation
- Misleading or unethical resume enhancements

## 🧠 Core Principles

- ATS-aware, not ATS-obsessed
- Human-first language and tone
- Explainable and consistent recommendations
- Ethical optimization (no false or misleading content)
- Transparency over magic scores

## 🧩 Planned Core Modules

1. **Resume Parsing Engine**

   - Extract structured data from PDF and Word resumes
   - Section detection (experience, skills, education, etc.)

2. **ATS Compatibility Analyzer**

   - Keyword coverage and contextual usage
   - Formatting and structure checks
   - ATS risk indicators (overuse, underuse, gaps)

3. **Human Readability Scoring Engine**

   - Readability metrics (e.g., Flesch–Kincaid)
   - Flow, clarity, and sentence-quality evaluation

4. **Paraphrasing & Humanization Engine**

   - Rewrite suggestions that sound natural
   - Preserve meaning while improving clarity
   - Avoid keyword stuffing

5. **Explainability & Feedback Layer**
   - Clear reasoning behind every suggestion
   - Actionable feedback instead of vague scores
