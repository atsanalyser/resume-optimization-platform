ATS-aware, human-friendly resume optimization engine


# Resume Optimization Platform

## Vision
Build a resume optimization system that balances ATS compatibility with human readability,
helping candidates pass automated screening without sounding robotic.

## Problems We Solve
- Over-optimization for ATS that hurts human readability
- Keyword stuffing without context
- AI-generated resume text that feels unnatural
- Lack of explanation behind optimization suggestions

## Core Principles
- ATS-aware, not ATS-obsessed
- Human-first language
- Consistent and explainable suggestions
- Ethical optimization (no misleading content)

## Core Modules (Planned)
1. Resume Parsing Engine
2. ATS Compatibility Analyzer
3. Human Readability Scoring Engine
4. Paraphrasing & Humanization Engine
5. Explainability & Feedback Layer

## Status
🚧 Project initialized – architecture design in progress.
